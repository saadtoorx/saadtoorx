# 👋 Hi — I’m Saad Toor

👨‍🔧 **AI Engineer | Electrical Engineer | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Agentic AI | Robotics**  
⚡ I solve real-world problems by blending hardware intuition with smart software — building practical AI systems, multi-agent workflows, and deployable apps.  
📚 Currently exploring the intersection of **intelligent systems, security, and automation**.

---

## 🔭 What I build
I design and ship end-to-end AI & robotics projects — from research prototypes to deployed demos on Hugging Face Spaces. My focus areas include agentic AI (multi-agent orchestration with CrewAI), applied NLP & CV, embedded systems, reinforcement learning, and deploying real, usable applications with Streamlit / Gradio.

---

## 💡 Highlights

- Hands-on with **multi-agent systems** (CrewAI) — architected agents that collaborate, share context, and produce download-ready plans & reports.  
- Built full apps (Streamlit + Hugging Face Spaces) combining web research, scraping, LLM reasoning, and structured outputs.  
- Strong foundation in ML fundamentals (regression, classification, recommenders) and practical model deployment.  
- Embedded & robotics experience — sensor systems, control loops, and RL-based behaviors integrated with ML models.  
- Comfortable across the stack: data, models, APIs, UI, hardware, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Core Skills

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, C/C++ (Arduino), Streamlit, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn  
- **AI / ML:** Agentic AI, LLMs, NLP, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Classical ML  
- **Robotics / Embedded:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors, motor control, ROS (basics), signal processing  
- **Tools & Platforms:** CrewAI, OpenAI, Hugging Face, ChromaDB, LangChain tools, Serper-like search/scraping tools  
- **Engineering:** API integration, deployment to Hugging Face Spaces, hardware interfacing, reproducible `requirements.txt`

## 🤖 Robotics & Embedded Systems (selected)

I’m also an Electrical Engineer — I build hardware-first projects that combine embedded systems with ML / RL:

- **Smart Electric ATV using Raspberry Pi (FYP)** — Final Year Project: autonomous / assisted behaviors, sensor fusion, and control integration with Raspberry Pi.  
- **Arduino-Based Home Automation** — sensor-driven automation, relay control, and mobile UI control.  
- **Gesture-Controlled Radar Car** — real-time gesture recognition + radar/ultrasonic sensors for responsive control.  
- **RFID Security System** — access control using RFID with logging and alerting.  
- **Automatic Bottle Filling & Capping System** — industrial automation prototype with actuators and PLC-style control logic.

These projects combine signal processing, control loops, embedded programming, and—where appropriate—ML or RL for smarter behavior.

## 🚀 How I work (short)
1. Problem → Data: define metrics & collect/clean data.  
2. Prototype: baselines → iterate with DL/LLMs or RL for control tasks.  
3. Agent design (multi-agent projects): define roles, tools, task outputs & contexts.  
4. Integrate & ship: APIs, UI (Streamlit), downloads (json/md/pdf), deploy to Hugging Face.  
5. Iterate from user feedback and add monitoring/visualizations.
